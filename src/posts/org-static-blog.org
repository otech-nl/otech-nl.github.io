This website and its blog are written in [[https://orgmode.org/][orgmode]], exported to HTML through [[https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog/][org-static-blog]], and published through [[https://pages.github.com/][Github pages]].

A few tips for /org-static-blog/:

- Drafts can also be used as static pages. So, for example, I have a ~index.org~ that becomes my landing page (after renaming ~org-static-blog-index-file~).
- Use relative file names for references, so ~./files/img.png~ instead of  ~/files/img.png~ or ~files/img.png~, to prevent /orgmode/ to throw and ~Unable to resolve link~ error.

Other considerations:

- The dates of blogs are of their first publication. If I make any changes to them later, this can be traced through [[https://github.com/otech-nl/otech-nl.github.io][github]].
- There is no way to leave comments.
